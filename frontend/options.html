        Many people don't think about the way that not only their offline but their online activities can contribute to their carbon footprint!! The tips below can help reduce your digital carbon emissions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Stream</strong> content in <strong>standard definition (e.g. 480p)</strong>  instead of HD (1080p) or 4K to save up to 75% of energy.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose</strong>  browsers like <strong>Opera or Firefox</strong> that are optimized for lower energy consumption.</li>
        <li><strong>Prioritize</strong>  the download of music or podcasts </strong>to your device once</strong> and replay from local storage instead of streaming multiple times.</li>
        <li><strong>Regularly</strong>  delete old emails, especially those with large attachments, to </strong>minimize energy used</strong> for data storage.</li>
        <li><strong>Use</strong>  smart plugs that </strong>cut off power supply to fully charged devices</strong> or invest in chargers with automatic power-off functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduce</strong>  the digital carbon footprint of your website by </strong>compressing images</strong> using tools like TinyPNG and </strong>minifying JavaScript and CSS files</strong>.</li>
